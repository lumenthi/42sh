Yo,

Be sure to read the history part in:
	- includes/shell.h
to get all informations about the variable and functions that is used for history manipulation

and check:
	- srcs/history/history.c
	- srcs/builtins/ft_history/ft_history.c
if u want to check source code

1st file contains all functions that manipulate our shell history

2nd file contains everything about the builtin history based on the bash behaviour

To do:
		- 42 norm;
		- Parsing part (builtin)
		- Multiple options support (builtin)
			exemple:	- history -ca test.txt
						- history -c -a test.txt
		- Multiple args when for some options (builtin)
			exemple:	- history -a test1 test2
