Yo,

Be sure to read the history part in:
	- includes/shell.h
to get all informations about variables and functions that are used for history manipulation

and check:
	- srcs/history/history.c
	- srcs/builtins/ft_history/ft_history.c
if u want to look at source code

1st file contains all functions that manipulate our shell history

2nd file contains everything about the builtin history based on the bash behaviour

Feel free to test my history system/history builtin and report bugs if you find one :)

To do:
		- 42 norm;
